# JGameGridLocal
Can use local jdk with a batch script to run java files from .\robotsim\examples
## How to use
First clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/Devendra255/JGameGridLocal.git
```
OR
Download the zip. and extract it.

if you have JKD install you can directrly run sim.bat file
but if you dont have JKD install you can download the JDK Compressed Archive

from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

extract it into this projects folder and rename it to just jdk (all small)
or if you want to install java globaly you can do that way too.

then run sim.bat file
